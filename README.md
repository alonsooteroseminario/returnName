The international team is composed by four Civil Engineers with a strong background in Software Development:
- [Rafael Anton](https://github.com/antonrafael) (Joinville, Brazil / GMT-3)
- [Chen Chih Yuan](https://github.com/ChenChihYuan) (Tokyo, Japan / GMT+9)
- [Luis Otero](https://github.com/alonsooteroseminario) (Vancouver, Canada / GMT-7)
- [Carlos Villagrasa](https://github.com/cvillagrasa) (Barcelona, Spain / GMT+2)

Yes, we tried to maximize the timezone difference in order to have always at least one member awake and 
ready to code the awesome. 

## Hack description
Speckle and its Connectors enable previously inconceivable workflows among a variety of software 
within the AEC industry. But what if it could be even better?

Usually, engineering and architecture firms, make heavy use of messaging apps such as Slack or 
Discord during their daily routine. Our hack allows any traditional user to interact with a bot 
via natural language, which will allow to commit directly to the speckle-server, and ultimately 
trigger changes within the authoring software.
